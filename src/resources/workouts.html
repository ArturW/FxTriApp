        <h4>Typical Workouts</h4>
        <h4>Zone 1: Recovery Mainset</h4>
        (1) Recovery workout.  Train steadily in Zone 1 following high-intenisty day workouts in Zone 4 and 5.
        <h4>Zone 2: Aerobic Threshold Mainsets</h4>
        (1) Exercise for more than 1 hour, looking for improvements over time at the same heart rate.       
        <h4>Zone 3: Tempo Mainsets</h4>
        (1) Train steadily from 20 to 90 minutes.<br>       
        (2) Tempo Intervals.  Complete 30 to 90 minutes of work intervals that are 12 to 20 minutes in duration, with recovery intervals that are one-fourth long.
        <h4>Zone 4: Sub-Lactate Threshold Mainsets</h4>
        (1) Cruise intervals.  Complete 30 to 60 mintues of intervals that are 6 to 12 minutes long, with recovery intervals that are one-fourth long.<br>
        (2) Cruise steady state.  Train steadily in Zone 4 for 20-30 minutes.
        <h4>Zone 5a: Lactate Threshold Mainsets</h4>
        (1) Cruise intervals.  Complete 30 to 60 minutes of intervals that are 6 to 12 minutes long, with recovery intervals that are one-fourth long.<br>
        (2) Cruise steady state.  Train steadily in Zone 5a for 20-30 minutes.
        <h4>Zone 5b: Aerobic Capacity Mainsets</h4>
        (1) Aerobic capacity intervals.  Complete 12-20 minutes total work intervals that are 2-4 minutes long.
        Recovery intervals initially are as long as the work intervals.  Shorten the recovery intervals to better simulate the event.<br>
        (2) 30-30s.  Alternate 30 seconds at aerobic capacity effort, pace, or power with 30 seconds at recovery effort, pace, or power.  Build up to 24 such intervals over 3-4 weeks.
